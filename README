This repository contains a proof of concept implementation of tasks
that can be interrupted more robustly. The root problem here is that
not all Java classes detect interruption and sometimes need to be
helped; for example an underlying socket could be closed. Because
executors by default don't support this functionality, we need to do
a little dance to make it possible.

In a nutshell, tasks need to implement CancellableCallable and then
run using CancellableExecutor. The remaining classes are used for
plumbing.
